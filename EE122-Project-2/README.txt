We had several challenges to overcome in regards implementing this project. One was our own personal commitments, which took most of our individual time in the past month. From the standpoint of our experience on the project, implementing withdrawal was one of our major obstacles in completing our work because we had to rely on external tests and it was initially confusing to comprehend. Though useful in the end, it took a while to get used to using NetVis in conjunction with our assumptions of the test cases. Finally, our implementation involves extra packets being sent, and it caused one of the cases that Jaime Tsao had available in his test to fail.

One feature that would improve our router would be the implementation of efficient packet delivery that does not allow for extra packets. A more relevant feature is to introduce hold-down updates on top of split horizons and poison reverse updates. Hold-downs can be implemented in order to prevent regular update messages from improperly reinstating a route that might have gone bad. Hold-downs will tell routers to hold down any changes that could affect routes for a period of time. 

No extra credit features were added.
